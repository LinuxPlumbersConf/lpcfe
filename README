This is "lpcfe", the front-end system used to host the 2020 edition of the
Linux Plumbers Conference.  It is released just in case it is useful to
somebody, but it is very much written to satisfy the needs of a single,
one-week conference and is not presented as a general solution.

About the only dependency here is the Quixote web framework.  This code
needs *version 3.0*, though; it will not work with 3.1.  If you are running
Python 3.7 or later, you will also need to cherry-pick commit 525eaff from
the master branch, and 4631446 is recommended as well.

Please let don't hesitate to contact me if you have any questions.
